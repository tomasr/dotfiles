1.  Intro                                       *VimExplorer-start*

What is VimExplorer ?
VimExplorer is a file manager, it can do a lot of file operations such as
copy, delete, move, preview, search and so on. Also it has a variety of other
capacities and customization abilities.

You can start VimExplorer by the following command:
>
        :VE
<
Then it will ask you for the starting directory, default is the current path.
>
        VimExplorer (directory): /home/username/
<
You can change it to some other directories or just push "Enter" to start it.

The second approach to start VimExplorer:
>
        :VE [directory]
<
Example:
>
        :VE /usr/src/
<
Now, VimExplorer will start using the path '/usr/src/'. When you are typing
the path, <tab> and <ctrl-d> will help you to complete the path automatically.
After all of these operations, you can see a new tab which has two panels
within it, one is the "Tree Panel" and the other is "File Panel". From now you
will have a happy journey using the powerful file manager.

==============================================================================
3.  Directory Browsing                          *VimExplorer-browse*

3.1  Tree Browsing                              *VimExplorer-treebrowse*

Press "Enter" on one tree node will change the path and add the new path to
browse history. By default, if a directory has it's own child directories, |+|
will be displayed before it's name, and It will cause a little performance
lost.  If you don't need this feature ,set the following variable to zero can
disable it.
>
    let VEConf_showFolderStatus = 0
<
There are some differences between win32 and other platforms. In win32, there
are several root nodes (such as C:\,D:\), but one root node (/) in other
platforms.

3.2  File Browsing                              *VimExplorer-filebrowse*

The file panel consist of two parts: the path in the top and the following
file list. Every line of the file list consist from the following regions:

[*] {file-name}         [file-size] {permission} {modify-time}

The file panel can sort by type, file name and date. Hotkey |i| is used to
cycle between these modes. Default sort mode controlled by following variable:
>
    VEConf_filePanelSortType

<
See Customization section for more details.

3.3  Forward and Backward                       *VimExplorer-forbackward*

When using "Enter" switch to an new folder, the path will be add to browse
history. Then you can use |<c-o>| and |<c-i>| to go backward and forward.
Hotkey |b| is used to list all browse history, select by number or mouse can
take you directory to that path.

By default, the depth of browse history is 100. Controled by this variable:
>
    VEConf_browseHistory
<

3.4  Favorites                                  *VimExplorer-favorite*

The favorite folder list is saved to the file $HOME/.ve_favorite . It will be
updated when new folder is added to favorite by hotkey |F|. The format of
".ve_favorite" is very simple: every line is a path, so edit it is quite
easy.

3.5  Temp Marks                                 *VimExplorer-tempmark*

Just like the favorites, |ma| put current path into register 'a', and |'a| can
jump to the path. |J| is used to list every non empty register. All paths in
register will disappear after VimExplorer exists.

==============================================================================
4.  Marks                                       *VimExplorer-mark*

The simplest way is to press <space> upon a file. There will be a '*' before
marked files and also be displayed in a different color.
There are three way to mark files:

4.1  Single File Marks                          *VimExplorer-marksingle*

<space>    Invert selection, move the cursor down.
<s-space>  Move the cursor up, then invert selection.
Just like most of vim commands, 5<space> will mark 5 files start from current
cursor.

4.2  Visual Marks                               *VimExplorer-markvisual*

<space> in visual mode will invert selected these files.

4.3  Regexp Marks                               *VimExplorer-markregexp*

Hotkey: |Mr|
Only the file name is the target of regexp match. Example:
>
    Mark file (regexp): ^abc.*\.vim$
<
It will mark all vim scripts start with abc. The following functionalities is
derived from this feature:
|Mv|  mark all vim scripts.
|Me|  mark all executable files.
|Md|  mark all directories.
and |Mc| to clear all marks.

==============================================================================
5.  File Operations                             *VimExplorer-fileoperation*

5.2  Move                                       *VimExplorer-move*

There are several hotkey used to copy/cut files:
|yy| and |sy| in normal mode ,|y| in visual mode is to copy file.
|xx| and |sx| in normal mode ,|x| in visual mode is to cut file.
|p| paste file.
Note that the clipboard is shared between all VimExplorers ,you can cut in one
VE tab and paste in another.

5.3  Delete                                     *VimExplorer-delete*

using this command.

5.5  Search                                     *VimExplorer-search*

7.2  Hotkey Customization                       *VimExplorer-custhotkey*

All user defined hotkeys are controlled by the two dicts:
|g:VEConf_treeHotkey|    and    |g:VEConf_fileHotkey|
Example:
>
    let g:VEConf_treeHotkey = {}
    let g:VEConf_treeHotkey.help = '??'
    let g:VEConf_treeHotkey.quitVE = 'qq'
    let g:VEConf_treeHotkey.switchPanel = '<s-tab>'
<
All definable hotkeys and their default bindings refer to section 2 .

7.3.  Command Customization                     *VimExplorer-custcommand*

VimExplorer supports three types of command interface:
single file hotkeys and actions, multi file hotkeys and actions and normal
hotkeys and actions.
They are controlled by these variables:

    |VEConf_singleFileActions|    |VEConf_singleFileHotKeys|

    |VEConf_multiFileActions|     |VEConf_multiFileHotKeys|

    |VEConf_normalActions|        |VEConf_normalHotKeys|

All of them are dicts. Example:
>
    let VEConf_normalActions = {}
    let VEConf_normalHotKeys = {}
    let VEConf_normalHotKeys['test1'] = 'T1'
    function! VEConf_normalActions['test1']()
        Renamer
    endfunction
<
"test1" is the key. VimExplorer will bind the hotkey and corresponding actions
automatically.
>
    let VEConf_singleFileActions = {}
    let VEConf_singleFileHotKeys = {}
    let VEConf_singleFileHotKeys['test2'] = 'T2'
    function! VEConf_singleFileActions['test2'](path)
        call VEPlatform.system("notepad.exe " . VEPlatform.escape(a:path))
    endfunction
<
Here, parameter "path" is the path of file under cursor.
>
    let VEConf_multiFileActions = {}
    let VEConf_multiFileHotKeys = {}
    let VEConf_multiFileHotKeys['test3'] = 'T3'
    function! VEConf_multiFileActions['test3'](fileList)
        for i in a:fileList
            call VEPlatform.start("nautilus " . i)
        endfor
    endfunction
<
Parameter "fileList" consists of all paths of marked files.
In addition, VimExplorer provides some platform independent functions:
>
    VEPlatform.start(path)
    VEPlatform.system(cmd)
    VEPlatform.copyfile(filename,topath)
    VEPlatform.search(filename,path)
    VEPlatform.deleteSingle(path)
<
These functions can be used in user defined actions.

9.  Problems and Fixes                          *VimExplorer-problems*

                                                *VimExplorer-p1*
P1.  Case sensitive in Win32.
     At present, the path in win32 is case sensitive. Pay attention to this
     when starting VE, editing the favorite list or using <c-g> to change
     path. A good suggestion is using <tab> or <ctrl-d> to complete path
     automatically.

                                                *VimExplorer-p2*
P2.  'wildignre' option cause some files disappeared.
     If 'wildignore' is not empty, glob() function will not return files
     matching the file pattern listed in it, then you may find some files
     disappeared in the file panel.
